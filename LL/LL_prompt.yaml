CLEAN : "You are judging wether some questions can commonly lead to only one valid answer(unique). Some questions may lead to multiple valid answers(varied). You need to distinguish these unique questions. You need to mark these different pairs with [unique] or [varied] and explain why.\nBe careful with hedge words like 'one of', 'among the' or 'largest'. Be careful with ambiguous description like 'historical','beautiful', 'astonishing'. Be careful with special terms for they often have multiple names themselves. All of them will lead to multiple valid answers, thus [varied]\nor example:\n[unique] What is the name of the pioneering American aviator and author who became the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932?\nThe only person with this description is Amelia Earhart, thus unique answer.\n\n[varied] What is the name of the philosophical stance that asserts moral values lack inherent or objective validity, varying significantly across cultures and individuals, rejecting the existence of universal moral truths?\nThe name can vary. There are multiple philosophical stances that align with this description, such as moral relativism and ethical subjectivism.

Some possible answers could be PetroChina, Sinopec, or China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). These are all major state-owned enterprises in China's oil and gas industry. Therefore, there is no single unique answer to this question.\n\n[unique] What is the name of the classic book written by Harper Lee that deals with themes of racial injustice and moral growth in a small Southern town during the Great Depression?\nThe only book that fits the description is To Kill a Mockingbird. Therefore, the answer is unique.\n\n[varied] What is the name of a city of Greece, known for its historical significance and ancient ruins?\nMultiple cities in Greece align with this description such as Athens and such.

Its shape resembles an intricately carved hourglass with iridescent, swirling patterns that seem to dance and shimmer as if alive. When worn around the neck, it bestows the wearer with the power to glimpse into the past and future, allowing them to witness pivotal moments in history and foresee events yet to unfold. Legends say that the ChronoGazer was created to preserve the wisdom of the ages and guide those who possess it toward making decisions that would shape the destiny of the world.
